# Manage Replication

Harper instance clustering and replication can be configured directly through the Harper Studio. It is recommended to read through the [clustering documentation](../../developers/clustering/) first to gain a strong understanding of Harper clustering behavior.



All clustering configuration is handled through the **replication** page of the Harper Studio, accessed with the following instructions:

1) Navigate to the [Harper Studio Organizations](https:/studio.harperdb.io/organizations) page.

2) Click the appropriate organization that the instance belongs to.

3) Select your desired instance.

4) Click **replication** in the instance control bar.

Note, the **replication** page will only be available to super users.

## Initial Configuration

Harper instances do not have clustering configured by default. The Harper Studio will walk you through the initial configuration. Upon entering the **replication** screen for the first time you will need to complete the following configuration. Configurations are set in the **enable clustering** panel on the left while actions are described in the middle of the screen. It is worth reviewing the [Creating a Cluster User](../../developers/clustering/creating-a-cluster-user) document before proceeding.

1) Enter Cluster User username. (Defaults to `cluster_user`). 
2) Enter Cluster Password. 
3) Review and/or Set Cluster Node Name. 
4) Click **Enable Clustering**.
   
At this point the Studio will restart your Harper Instance, required for the configuration changes to take effect.

## Manage Clustering
Once initial clustering configuration is completed you a presented with a clustering management screen with the following properties:

* **connected instances**

    Displays all instances within the Studio Organization that this instance manages a connection with.

* **unconnected instances**

    Displays all instances within the Studio Organization that this instance does not manage a connection with.

* **unregistered instances**

    Displays all instances outside the Studio Organization that this instance manages a connection with.

* **manage clustering**

    Once instances are connected, this will display clustering management options for all connected instances and all databases and tables.

## Connect an Instance

Harper Instances can be clustered together with the following instructions.

1) Ensure clustering has been configured on both instances and a cluster user with identical credentials exists on both.

2) Identify the instance you would like to connect from the **unconnected instances** panel.

3) Click the plus icon next the appropriate instance.

4) If configurations are correct, all databases will sync across the cluster, then appear in the **manage clustering** panel. If there is a configuration issue, a red exclamation icon will appear, click it to learn more about what could be causing the issue.

## Disconnect an Instance

Harper Instances can be disconnected with the following instructions.

1) Identify the instance you would like to disconnect from the **connected instances** panel.

2) Click the minus icon next the appropriate instance.

## Manage Replication

Subscriptions must be configured in order to move data between connected instances. Read more about subscriptions here: Creating A Subscription. The **manage clustering** panel displays a table with each row representing an channel per instance. Cells are bolded to indicate a change in the column. Publish and subscribe replication can be configured per table with the following instructions:

1) Identify the instance, database, and table for replication to be configured.

2) For publish, click the toggle switch in the **publish** column.

3) For subscribe, click the toggle switch in the **subscribe** column.

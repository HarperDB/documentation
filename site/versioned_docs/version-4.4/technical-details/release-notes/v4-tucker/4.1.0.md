# 4.1.0

HarperDB 4.1 introduces the ability to use worker threads for concurrently handling HTTP requests. Previously this was handled by processes. This shift provides important benefits in terms of better control of traffic delegation with support for optimized load tracking and session affinity, better debuggability, and reduced memory footprint.

This means debugging will be much easier for custom functions. If you install/run HarperDB locally, most modern IDEs like WebStorm and VSCode support worker thread debugging, so you can start HarperDB in your IDE, and set breakpoints in your custom functions and debug them.

The associated routing functionality now includes session affinity support. This can be used to consistently route users to the same thread which can improve caching locality, performance, and fairness. This can be enabled in with the [`http.sessionAffinity` option in your configuration](../../../deployments/configuration#http).

HarperDB 4.1's NoSQL query handling has been revamped to consistently use iterators, which provide an extremely memory efficient mechanism for directly streaming query results to the network _as_ the query results are computed. This results in faster Time to First Byte (TTFB) (only the first record/value in a query needs to be computed before data can start to be sent), and less memory usage during querying (the entire query result does not need to be stored in memory). These iterators are also available in query results for custom functions and can provide means for custom function code to iteratively access data from the database without loading entire results. This should be a completely transparent upgrade, all HTTP APIs function the same, with the one exception that custom functions need to be aware that they can't access query results by `[index]` (they should use array methods or for-in loops to handle query results).

4.1 includes configuration options for specifying the location of database storage files. This allows you to specifically locate database directories and files on different volumes for better flexibility and utilization of disks and storage volumes. See the [storage configuration](../../../../deployments/configuration#storage) and [schemas configuration](../../../../deployments/configuration#schemas) for information on how to configure these locations.

Logging has been revamped and condensed into one `hdb.log` file. See [logginglogging for more information.

A new operation called `cluster_network` was added, this operation will ping the cluster and return a list of enmeshed nodes.

Custom Functions will no longer automatically load static file routes, instead the `@fastify/static` plugin will need to be registered with the Custom Function server. See [Host A Static Web UI-static](https:/docs.harperdb.io/docs/v/4.1/custom-functions/host-static).

Updates to S3 import and export mean that these operations now require the bucket `region` in the request. Also, if referencing a nested object it should be done in the `key` parameter. See examples [here](../../../developers/operations-api/bulk-operations#import-from-s3).

Due to the AWS SDK v2 reaching end of life support we have updated to v3. This has caused some breaking changes in our operations `import_from_s3` and `export_to_s3`:

* A new attribute `region` will need to be supplied
* The `bucket` attribute can no longer have trailing slashes. Slashes will now need to be in the `key`.

Starting HarperDB without any command (just `harperdb`) now runs HarperDB like a standard process, in the foreground. This means you can use standard unix tooling for interacting with the process and is conducive for running HarperDB with systemd or any other process management tool. If you wish to have HarperDB launch itself in separate background process (and immediately terminate the shell process), you can do so by running `harperdb start`.

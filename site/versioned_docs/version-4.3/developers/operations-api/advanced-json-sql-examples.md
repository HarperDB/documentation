## Use search_json in a where clause
This example shows how we can use SEARCH_JSON to filter out records in a WHERE clause. The production_companies attribute holds an object array of companies that produced each movie, we want to only see movies which were produced by Marvel Studios.  Our expression is a filter '$[name="Marvel Studios"]' this tells the function to iterate the production_companies array and only return entries where the name is "Marvel Studios".

### Body

```json
{
    "operation": "sql",
    "sql": "SELECT title, release_date FROM movies.movie where search_json('$[name=\"Marvel Studios\"]', production_companies) IS NOT NULL ORDER BY release_date"
}
```

### Response: 200

## Use search_json to show the movies with the largest casts
This example shows how we can use SEARCH_JSON to perform a simple calculation on JSON and order by the results.  The cast attribute holds an object array of details around the cast of a movie. We use the expression '$count(id)' that counts each id and returns the value back which we alias in SQL as cast_size which in turn gets used to sort the rows.

### Body

```json
{
    "operation": "sql",
    "sql": "SELECT movie_title, search_json('$count(id)', `cast`) as cast_size FROM movies.credits ORDER BY cast_size DESC LIMIT 10"
}
```

### Response: 200

        "cast_size": 312
    },

        "cast_size": 259

## search_json as a condition, in a select with a table join
This example shows how we can use SEARCH_JSON to find movies where at least of 2 our favorite actors from Marvel films have acted together then list the movie, its overview, release date, and the actors names and their characters.  The WHERE clause performs a count on credits.cast attribute that have the matching actors. The SELECT performs the same filter on the cast attribute and performs a transform on each object to just return the actor's name and their character.

```json
{
    "operation": "sql",
    "sql": "SELECT m.title, m.overview, m.release_date, search_json('$[name in [\"Robert Downey Jr.\", \"Chris Evans\", \"Scarlett Johansson\", \"Mark Ruffalo\", \"Chris Hemsworth\", \"Jeremy Renner\", \"Clark Gregg\", \"Samuel L.

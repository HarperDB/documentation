# Components

Harper components are a core Harper concept defined as flexible JavaScript based _extensions_ of the highly extensible core Harper platform. They are executed by Harper directly and have complete access to the Harper [Global APIs](../../technical-details/reference/globals) (such as `Resource`, `databases`, and `tables`).

A key aspect to components are their extensibility; components can be built on other components. For example, a [Harper Application](../applications/) is a component that uses many other components. The [application template](https://github.com/HarperDB/application-template) demonstrates many of Harper's built-in components such as `rest` (for automatic REST endpoint generation), `graphqlSchema` (for table schema definitions), and many more.

From management to development, the following pages document everything a developer needs to know about Harper components.

- [Managing Components](./managing) - developing, installing, deploying, and executing Harper components locally and remotely
- [Technical Reference](./reference) - detailed, technical reference for component development
- [Built-In Components](./built-in) - documentation for all of Harper's built-in components (i.e. `rest`)

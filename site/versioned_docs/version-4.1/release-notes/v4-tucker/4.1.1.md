### HarperDB 4.1.1, Tucker Release
06/16/2023

* HarperDB uses improved logic for determining default heap limits and thread counts. When running in a restricted container and on NodeJS 18.15+, HarperDB will use the constrained memory limit to determine heap limits for each thread. In more memory constrained servers with many CPU cores, a reduced default thread count will be used to ensure that excessive memory is not used by many workers. You may still  define your own thread count (with `http`/`threads`) in the [configuration](../../configuration).
* An option has been added for [disabling the republishing NATS messages](../../configuration), which can provide improved replication performance in a fully connected network.
* Improvements to our OpenShift container.
* Dependency security updates.

* **Bug Fixes**

* Fixed a bug in reporting database metrics in the `system_information` operation.

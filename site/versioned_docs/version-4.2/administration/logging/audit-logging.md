# Audit Logging

### Audit log

The audit log uses a standard HarperDB table to track transactions. For each table a user creates, a corresponding table will be created to track transactions against that table.

Audit log is enabled by default. To diable the audit log, set `logging.auditLog` to false in the config file, `harperdb-config.yaml`. Then restart HarperDB for those changes to take place. Note, the audit is required to be enabled for real-time messaging.

### Audit Log Operations

#### read\_audit\_log

The `read_audit_log` operation is flexible, enabling users to query with many parameters. All operations search on a single table. Filter options include timestamps, usernames, and table hash values. Additional examples found in the [HarperDB API documentation](../../developers/operations-api/logs).

**Search by Timestamp**

```json
{
    "operation": "read_audit_log",
    "schema": "dev",
    "table": "dog",
    "search_type": "timestamp",
    "search_values": [
        1660585740558
    ]
}
```

There are three outcomes using timestamp.

* `"search_values": []` - All records returned for specified table
* `"search_values": [1660585740558]` - All records after provided timestamp
* `"search_values": [1660585740558, 1760585759710]` - Records "from" and "to" provided timestamp

**Search by Username**

```json
{
    "operation": "read_audit_log",
    "schema": "dev",
    "table": "dog",
    "search_type": "username",
    "search_values": [
        "admin"
    ]
}
```

The above example will return all records whose `username` is "admin."

***

**Search by Primary Key**

```json
{
    "operation": "read_audit_log",
    "schema": "dev",
    "table": "dog",
    "search_type": "hash_value",
    "search_values": [
        318
    ]
}
```

The above example will return all records whose primary key (`hash_value`) is 318.

#### read\_audit\_log Response

The example that follows provides records of operations performed on a table. One thing of note is that the `read_audit_log` operation gives you the `original_records`.

```json
{
    "operation": "update",
    "user_name": "HDB_ADMIN",
    "timestamp": 1607035559122.277,
    "hash_values": [
        1,
        2
    ],
    "records": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "breed": "Muttzilla",
            "age": 6,
            "__updatedtime__": 1607035559122
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "age": 7,
            "__updatedtime__": 1607035559121
        }
    ],
    "original_records": [
        {
            "__createdtime__": 1607035556801,
            "__updatedtime__": 1607035556801,
            "age": 5,
            "breed": "Mutt",
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Penny"
        },
        {
            "__createdtime__": 1607035556801,
            "__updatedtime__": 1607035556801,
            "age": 5,
            "breed": "Mutt",
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Harper"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### delete\_audit\_logs\_before

Just like with transaction logs, you can clean up your audit logs with the `delete_audit_logs_before` operation. It will delete audit log data according to the given parameters. The example below will delete records older than the timestamp provided.

```json
{
    "operation": "delete_audit_logs_before",
    "schema": "dev",
    "table": "cat",
    "timestamp": 1598290282817
}
```

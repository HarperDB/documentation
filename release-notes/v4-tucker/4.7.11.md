# 4.7.11

12/02/2025

- Limit message size to prevent oversized messages
- Restart 1/8th of the workers at a time for smoother restarts
- Add host and hostname to `listSSHKeys` response
- Lazy load the trusted components to avoid requiring the component loader too early
- Only guard certain core component names from being deployed
- Have `deploy-component` fail by default if a conflicting config entry exists (can be forced)
- Ensure that the resource cache is reset when a transaction is committed to avoid reading stale data
- Reset the `restartRequired` flag on restart
- Fix link to the configuration file documentation
- Fix `mergeHeaders` where set-cookie headers could get combined, and handle when array is passed with non-string values

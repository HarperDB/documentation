# 4.7.5

11/11/2025

- Transactions:
  - Reset transaction timestamp on commit so reused transactions receive a new timestamp and do not conflict with prior operations
  - Fix transaction timeout message to be accurate
  - Disallow `get()` with null/undefined more precisely; prevent misuse and improve safety
  - Fix handling of `create` with one/two arguments when `loadAsInstance=false`
- Compaction and database maintenance:
  - Move each compacted database into place immediately after its compaction completes
  - Do not disable database deletion when a record count discrepancy is expected due to skipped deletion entries
- Component loading/router:
  - Await `loadDataFile` so subsequent components can access the loaded data
  - Keep `scope.handleEntry()` promise-free while ensuring the initial load completes before loading the next component
- API/OpenAPI:
  - Fix hostname access for OpenAPI generation
- Dependencies:
  - Upgrade LMDB to address issue with returning loose pages to the free-list
- Bug fixes:
  - Correct nullish comparison logic to properly handle `null` values
- Applications:
  - Add Harper application lock file to avoid reinstalling application on every restart

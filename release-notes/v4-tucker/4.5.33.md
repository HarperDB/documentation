### HarperDB 4.5.33

11/5/2025

- Add option to mark a database as "sharded" so replication only connects to databases in the same shard, improving efficiency for sharded clusters.
- Reliability: ensure we never attempt to reference an audit entry when one is not recorded and always create an audit entry during conflict/CRDT resolutions; this prevents orphaned blobs and guarantees they can be cleaned up.
- Data integrity: assert that each transaction is recorded in the audit log.
- Maintenance: throttle blob cleanup to reduce system load and add a final log message indicating when orphan cleanup finishes.
- Fix: do not relocate records when their location is determined by id.
- Add a final cleanup log message when orphan blob cleanup finishes.

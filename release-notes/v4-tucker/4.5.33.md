### HarperDB 4.5.33

11/3/2025

- Add option to define a database as "sharded" so that replication will only create replication connections to other nodes' databases that are in the same shard, for better efficiency of sharded clusters.
- Fix the referencing of audit entries from records when no audit is specified, when cache resolution is forced through the no-cache flag, resulting in orphan blobs.

### HarperDB 4.5.36

11/20/2025

- Reduced frequency of unnecessary `end_txn` messages that were causing excess traffic from node without originating writes.
- Fix to allow `databases` config in replication support a database name as a string or an object
- Backport fix for ensuring that we don't failover connections (when failover is disabled) when re-connections take place.
- Update last received status when receiving sequence id updates for better reporting of cluster status

# Harper Tucker (Version 4)

HarperDB version 4 ([Tucker release](v4-tucker/tucker)) represents major step forward in database technology. This release line has ground-breaking architectural advancements including:

## <LatestPatchLink major={4} minor={7} label="4.7 alpha" />

- Component status monitoring for tracking loading and status changes across all components
- OCSP support for TLS certificate validation in replication and HTTP connections
- New analytics and licensing functionality for Fabric services integration
- Further improvements to the plugin API

## <LatestPatchLink major={4} minor={6} />

- Vector Indexing - 4.6 introduces a new Vector Indexing system based on Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs.
- New extension API - 4.6 introduces a new extension API for creating extensions components.
- Improved logging configurability - Logging can be dynamically updated and specifically configured for each component.
- Resource API - 4.6 has updated Resource APIs for ease of use.
- Data loader - 4.6 introduces a new data loader that allows for ensuring records exist as part of a component.

## <LatestPatchLink major={4} minor={5} />

- Blob Storage - 4.5 introduces a new [Blob storage system](/docs/reference/blob).
- Password Hashing Upgrade - two new password hashing algorithms for better security (to replace md5).
- New resource and storage Analytics

## <LatestPatchLink major={4} minor={4} />

- Native replication (codename "Plexus") which is faster, more efficient, secure, and reliable than the previous replication system and provides provisional sharding capabilities with a foundation for the future
- Computed properties that allow applications to define properties that are computed from other properties, allowing for composite properties that are calculated from other data stored in records without requiring actual storage of the computed value
- Custom indexing including composite, full-text indexing, and vector indexing

## <LatestPatchLink major={4} minor={3} />

- Relationships, joins, and broad new querying capabilities for complex and nested conditions, sorting, joining, and selecting with significant query optimizations
- More advanced transaction support for CRDTs and storage of large integers (with BigInt)
- Better management with new upgraded local studio and new CLI features

## <LatestPatchLink major={4} minor={2} />

- New component architecture and Resource API for advanced, robust custom database application development
- Real-time capabilites through MQTT, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events
- REST interface for intuitive, fast, and standards-compliant HTTP interaction
- Native caching capabilities for high-performance cache scenarios
- Clone node functionality

## <LatestPatchLink major={4} minor={1} />

- New streaming iterators mechanism that allows query results to be delivered to clients _while_ querying results are being processed, for incredibly fast time-to-first-byte and concurrent processing/delivery
- New thread-based concurrency model for more efficient resource usage

## <LatestPatchLink major={4} minor={0} />

- New clustering technology that delivers robust, resilient and high-performance replication
- Major storage improvements with highly-efficient adaptive-structure modified MessagePack format, with on-demand deserialization capabilities

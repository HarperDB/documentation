# 4.6.15

11/5/2025

- Audit logging robustness:
  - Always record an audit entry when conflict/CRDT resolutions are performed so all blobs retain a reference for eventual cleanup
  - Avoid referencing an audit entry when audit logging is disabled; ensure a new version is created when resolving a cache entry that replaces an existing one
- Blob cleanup improvements:
  - Reduce cleanup rate to limit resource usage under load
  - Add a final "orphan cleanup finished" log message
- Sharded deployments: do not connect to nodes with a database connection if the database is marked as sharded and is not in the same shard
- Stability: clear the application timeout timer to allow threads to exit gracefully when still running
- HTTP/router: fix missing `urlPath` option on initial entry handler creation (#2944, #2946)
- Memory monitoring: make the near‑limit heap snapshot threshold configurable and enable taking a snapshot before exhausting heap memory
- Data placement: avoid relocating records when location is determined by id
- Developer ergonomics: fix camelCase conversion typos in resource code

# Operations API

The operations API provides a full set of capabilities for configuring, deploying, administering, and controlling HarperDB. To send operations to the operations API, you send a POST request to the operations API endpoint, which [defaults to port 9925](../../deployments/configuration), on the root path, where the body is the operations object. These requests need to authenticated, which can be done with [basic auth](./security/basic-auth) or [JWT authentication](./security/jwt-auth). For example, a request to create a table would be performed as:

```http
POST https://my-harperdb-server:9925/
Authorization: Basic YourBase64EncodedInstanceUser:Pass
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "operation": "create_table",
    "table": "my-table"
}
```

## More Examples

Here is an example of using `curl` to make an operations API request:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://instance-subdomain.harperdbcloud.com' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic YourBase64EncodedInstanceUser:Pass' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
"operation": "create_schema",
"schema": "dev"
}'
```

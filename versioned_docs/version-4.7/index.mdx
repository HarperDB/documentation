Harper is an all-in-one backend technology that fuses database technologies, caching, application hosting, and messaging functions into a single system. Unlike traditional architectures where each piece runs independently and incurs extra costs and latency from serialization and network operations between processes, Harper systems can handle workloads seamlessly and efficiently.

Here, you'll find all things Harper, and everything you need to get started, troubleshoot issues, and make the most of our platform.

## Getting Started

The recommended approach for efficiently developing applications with Harper is to develop locally and deploy them to Harper Fabric, our distributed data application platform service. Our getting started guide will walk you through how to install Harper locally, sign up for Fabric service, build a simple application and deploy it.

# Core Concepts

Before you build your first app with Harper, it helps to understand a few key ideas. These concepts show you how Harper is structured and why itâ€™s flexible enough to power everything from a quick proof-of-concept to a production-ready platform.

## Components

**Components** are the building blocks of Harper.  
Theyâ€™re JavaScript-based modules that extend Harperâ€™s core, and they can talk directly to Harperâ€™s [Global APIs](../reference/globals) (databases, tables, resources).

Because components can build on top of each other, they give you composability. For example, both [Applications](../developers/applications/) and [Extensions](../developers/components/reference#extensions) are just kinds of components:

- **Plugins** add individual capabilities, like defining tables or serving static assets.
- **Applications** pull multiple plugins and resources together into a complete product.

ðŸ’¡ **Why it matters:** Instead of wiring up a backend from scratch, you can piece together pre-built functionality and get to working endpoints fast.

## Applications (a type of Component)

An **application** is a special kind of component that pulls everything together.  
Applications rely on plugins to do the work:

- Use `graphqlSchema` to define your data tables.
- Add `rest` to query that data instantly.
- Plug in `static` to serve files or front-end assets.

You can even run full frameworks like [Next.js](https://github.com/HarperDB/nextjs) or [Apollo](https://github.com/HarperDB/apollo) as Harper applications.

ðŸ’¡ **Why it matters:** Applications are how you ship real products on Harper. They let you stitch together resources, APIs, and UI in one place.

## Plugins (formerly Extensions)

**Plugins** are a special kind of component that are not meant to run standalone, but instead add features to applications or other components. These were originally called **extensions** (and the [extension API](../developers/components/reference#extensions) is still supported), but the new plugin API is simultaneously a simplification and extensibility upgrade.

Examples youâ€™ll see in the ecosystem include:

- **Built in extensions**: These are embedded in Harper and work out of the box. Examples include [graphqlSchema](../developers/components/built-in#graphqlschema) for database and table definitions, [rest](../developers/rest) for RESTful access to your data, and [static](../developers/components/built-in#static) for serving files or frontend assets.

- **Custom extensions**: These live outside of Harper and are installed from GitHub or npm. Harper supports a few official ones, and the ecosystem may include community plugins as well. Examples include [@harperdb/nextjs](https://github.com/HarperDB/nextjs) for Next.js integration and [@harperdb/apollo](https://github.com/HarperDB/apollo) for Apollo GraphQL.

:::info
ðŸ’¡ **Why it matters:** Plugins (formerly extensions) give Harper its flexibility. You can compose them into applications to get powerful functionality without writing boilerplate yourself.

## Resources

**Resources** are Harperâ€™s data layer and are implemented using the [`Resource`](../reference/resource/) class.  
They represent databases, tables, and other data entities, and they provide a unified API for accessing, querying, modifying, and monitoring records.

At the simplest level, resources let you:

- Define schemas and tables for your application data.
- Query and update that data through Harperâ€™s APIs.
- Extend the base `Resource` class with JavaScript to define custom data sources or behaviors.

Each `Resource` instance can represent a single record or a collection of records at a given point in time.  
Static methods on the `Resource` class handle common operations like parsing paths, running transactions, and enforcing access controls, while instance methods give you a transactional view of individual records.

:::info
ðŸ’¡ **Why it matters:** Whether youâ€™re working with standard tables or custom-defined resources, everything in Harperâ€™s data layer builds on the same model. This gives you consistency when modeling data and flexibility to extend it with your own logic. For full details, see the [Resource reference documentation](../reference/resource/).
:::

## Server

At the edge of Harper is the **server layer**, which connects your data to the outside world. Harper supports REST/HTTP, WebSockets, MQTT, and more. A single resource can be available through multiple protocols at onceâ€”so the same table can power a real-time dashboard, a mobile app, and a backend API.

:::info
ðŸ’¡ **Why it matters:** You donâ€™t have to choose between protocols. One data model, many ways to access it.

âœ… With these concepts in mind, youâ€™re ready to [build your first application](../getting-started/quickstart). Thatâ€™s where youâ€™ll see how Components, Resources, and Extensions come together in practice.

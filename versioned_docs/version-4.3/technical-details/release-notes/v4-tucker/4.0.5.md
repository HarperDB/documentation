### HarperDB 4.0.5, Tucker Release

02/15/2023

**Bug Fixes**

- CORE-2029 Improved the upgrade process for handling existing user TLS certificates and correctly configuring TLS settings. Added a prompt to upgrade to determine if new certificates should be created or existing certificates should be kept/used.
- Fix the way NATS connections are honored in a local environment.
- Do not define the certificate authority path to NATS if it is not defined in the HarperDB config.

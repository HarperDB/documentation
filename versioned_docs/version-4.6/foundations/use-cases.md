# Harper Use Cases

With so much functionality built in, the use cases span nearly all application systems. Some of the most popular are listed below, motivated by new levels of performance and system simplicity.

### Online Catalogs & Content Delivery

For use cases like e-commerce, real estate listing, and content-oriented sites, Harper’s breakthroughs in performance and distribution pay dividends in the form of better SEO and higher conversion rates. One common implementation leverages Harper’s [Next.js Component](https://github.com/HarperDB/nextjs) to host modern, performant frontend applications. Other implementations leverage the built-in caching layer and JavaScript application system to [server-side render pages](https://www.harpersystems.dev/development/tutorials/server-side-rendering-with-multi-tier-cache) that remain fully responsive because of built-in WebSocket connections.

### Data Delivery Networks

For use cases like real-time sports updates, flight tracking, and zero-day software update distribution, Harper is rapidly gaining popularity. Harper’s ability to receive and broadcast messages while simultaneously handling application logic and data storage streamlines operations and eliminates the need for multiple separate systems. To build an understanding of our messaging system function, refer to our [real-time documentation](../developers/real-time).

### Edge Inference Systems

Capturing, storing, and processing real-time data streams from client and IoT systems typically requires a stack of technology. Harper’s selective data replication and self-healing connections make for an ideal multi-tier system where edge and cloud systems both run Harper, making everything more performant.

[We’re happy](https://www.harpersystems.dev/contact) to walk you through how to do this.

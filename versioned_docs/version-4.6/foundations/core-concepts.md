# Core Concepts

Before you build your first app with Harper, it helps to understand a few key ideas. These concepts show you how Harper is structured and why itâ€™s flexible enough to power everything from a quick proof-of-concept to a production-ready platform.

## Components

**Components** are the building blocks of Harper.  
Theyâ€™re JavaScript-based modules that extend Harperâ€™s core, and they can talk directly to Harperâ€™s [Global APIs](../reference/globals) (databases, tables, resources).  

Because components can build on top of each other, they give you composability. For example, a [Harper Application](../developers/applications/) is itself a component, combining smaller pieces like the [rest](../reference/components/built-in-extensions#rest) component extension for automatic REST APIs and the [graphqlSchema](../reference/components/built-in-extensions#graphqlschema) component extension for defining tables.

ðŸ’¡ **Why it matters:** Instead of wiring up a backend from scratch, you can piece together pre-built functionality and get to working endpoints fast.

## Applications

An **application** is a special kind of component that pulls everything together.  
Applications rely on extensions to do the work:  
- Use `graphqlSchema` to define your data tables.  
- Add `rest` to query that data instantly.  
- Plug in `static` to serve files or front-end assets.  

You can even run full frameworks like [Next.js](https://github.com/HarperDB/nextjs) or [Apollo](https://github.com/HarperDB/apollo) as Harper applications.  

:::info
ðŸ’¡ **Why it matters:** Applications are how you ship real products on Harper. They let you stitch resources, APIs, and UI in one place.

## Resources

**Resources** are Harperâ€™s data layerâ€”databases, tables, and schemas. Theyâ€™re where your appâ€™s data lives. You can define them with GraphQL, extend them with JavaScript, and expose them through any Harper server protocol.  

:::info
ðŸ’¡ **Why it matters:** Whether youâ€™re building SaaS or content apps, everything starts with structured, queryable data. Resources are how Harper manages it.
:::

## Extensions

**Extensions** add features to your applications. Some common ones:  
- `graphqlSchema` for database and table definitions.  
- `@harperdb/nextjs` for Next.js integration.  
- `@harperdb/apollo` for an Apollo GraphQL backend.  

Extensions can depend on each other, so you can layer functionality.  

:::info
ðŸ’¡ **Why it matters:** Instead of reinventing the wheel, you extend Harper with what you need and focus on your business logic.
:::

## Plugins (Experimental)

**Plugins** are the next evolution of extensionsâ€”lighter, simpler, and more powerful. Theyâ€™re still experimental, but theyâ€™ll eventually replace extensions. You can explore the [plugin API](../reference/components/plugins.md) if youâ€™re curious.  

:::info
ðŸ’¡ **Why it matters:** Plugins reduce boilerplate and make it easier to extend Harper with custom behavior.
:::

## Server

At the edge of Harper is the **server layer**, which connects your data to the outside world. Harper supports REST/HTTP, WebSockets, MQTT, and more. A single resource can be available through multiple protocols at onceâ€”so the same table can power a real-time dashboard, a mobile app, and a backend API.  

:::info
ðŸ’¡ **Why it matters:** You donâ€™t have to choose between protocols. One data model, many ways to access it.

âœ… With these concepts in mind, youâ€™re ready to [build your first application](../getting-started/quickstart.md). Thatâ€™s where youâ€™ll see how Components, Resources, and Extensions come together in practice.

# Server-Sent Events (SSE)

There are times when you donâ€™t need a two-way connection. The client never needs to send data back, it only needs to stay in sync with what the server knows. For example, a dog adoption dashboard might show the availability of each dog, and all it has to do is keep that list updated in real time.

SSE (Server-Sent Events) is perfect for this. It gives you a persistent one-way stream from the server to the client, using simple HTTP. Harper makes this stream available on any resource path.

## Opening a connection to a record

On the client, you create an `EventSource` that points to the dog you want to follow.

```javascript
const es = new EventSource('https://server/dog/341', { withCredentials: true });
```

When the connection opens, it stays alive until you close it. Messages arrive as events you can listen for.

```javascript
es.onmessage = (event) => {
	const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
	renderDogProfile(data); // update the profile in your UI
};
```

## Handling errors and reconnects

SSE connections will automatically try to reconnect if they drop, but you should still handle errors gracefully.

```javascript
es.onerror = (err) => {
	console.error('sse error', err);
	showConnectionWarning();
};
```

When the user leaves the profile page, close the connection cleanly.

```javascript
es.close();
```

## Adding custom events from the server

By default, connecting to `/dog/341` streams record updates. But Harper also lets you enrich that stream by defining a `connect()` method on the resource. This lets you send your own events alongside updates.

```javascript
export class DogStream extends Resource {
	connect() {
		const outgoing = super.connect();

		// send a friendly reminder every 30 seconds
		const reminder = setInterval(() => {
			outgoing.send({ dogId: '341', notice: 'still looking for a home' });
		}, 30000);

		outgoing.on('close', () => {
			clearInterval(reminder);
		});

		return outgoing;
	}
}
```

Now the client receives both the automatic record updates and the serverâ€™s notices.

## Reading server messages on the client

On the client, branch on fields in the incoming event and update different parts of the UI.

```javascript
es.onmessage = (event) => {
	const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);

	if (msg.notice) {
		showNotice(msg.notice);
		return;
	}

	renderDogProfile(msg); // treat as a record update
};
```

## Why choose SSE for your app

- Lightweight and browser-native: just new EventSource().
- Automatic reconnects built into the browser.
- Ideal for dashboards, feeds, and one-way updates.
- Less complex than WebSockets when clients donâ€™t need to send data.

At this point, your adoption dashboard can show dog profiles that stay fresh automatically, display occasional server notices, and handle connection lifecycle gracefully, all without writing a line of custom client transport code.

When you want to adjust TLS, authentication, or ports, do that in your Harper configuration file. See the [Configuration page](../../deployments/configuration) for details.

ðŸ‘‰ If you later decide the client should also send messages back (like user comments or notes), [WebSockets](./websockets) give you that two-way channel.

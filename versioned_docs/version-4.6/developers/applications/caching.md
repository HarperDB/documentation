# Caching

In the [quickstart guide](../../getting-started/first-harper-app.md), you built a working Dog API in just a few minutes. That API is now ready to store and query data. But what happens when your application also needs to pull in data from other systems‚Äîsay, a third-party service that provides dog breed information?

If you hit that external API every time a user makes a request, you‚Äôll pay the cost in speed, reliability, and maybe even money. That‚Äôs where Harper‚Äôs built-in caching comes in. Harper lets you cache external data in the same tables and APIs you‚Äôre already using, so your app feels fast, reliable, and cost-efficient without you writing glue code.

## Step 1: Add a Cache Table

Caching in Harper works just like creating any other table. Open up your `schema.graphql` and add a cache table alongside your `Dog` table:

```graphql
type BreedCache @table(expiration: 3600) @export {
	id: ID @primaryKey
}
```

Here, `expiration: 3600` means cached entries expire after an hour. By exporting this table, you instantly get a REST API for it at `http://localhost:9926/BreedCache/`.

## Step 2: Connect to an External Source

Now let‚Äôs say you want to enrich your Dog records with breed details from an external API. Instead of hitting that API directly every time, we‚Äôll connect it to the `BreedCache` table.

Open `resources.js` and define a resource:

```javascript
class BreedAPI extends Resource {
	async get() {
		const response = await fetch(`https://dog-api.com/${this.getId()}`);
		return response.json();
	}
}

const { BreedCache } = tables;
BreedCache.sourcedFrom(BreedAPI);
```

That‚Äôs it. When your app calls /BreedCache/husky, Harper will:

- Check if ‚Äúhusky‚Äù is already in the cache.
- If not (or if it‚Äôs expired), fetch it from https://dog-api.com/husky.
- Store it in BreedCache so the next request is instant.

Harper even prevents ‚Äúcache stampedes‚Äù: if multiple users request the same breed at the same time, only one fetch goes out to the source.

## Step 3: Use the Cache in Your API

Now you can combine your Dogs with cached breed info. For example, imagine you added a ‚Äúbreed‚Äù attribute to your Dog table earlier:

```graphql
type Dog @table @export {
	id: ID @primaryKey
	name: String
	breed: String @indexed
	age: Int
}
```

You can enrich a Dog API request by querying both Dog and BreedCache. The Dog table is your source of truth, while BreedCache ensures you never block on slow or flaky external APIs.

## Step 4: Keep Your Cache Fresh

By default, caches are passive: they refresh only when requested and expired. Sometimes that‚Äôs fine. Other times, you‚Äôll want them to stay in sync as soon as data changes at the source. Harper supports both:

- Passive caching: great for data that doesn‚Äôt change often (like dog breed characteristics).
- Active caching: connect to a subscription or webhook so Harper gets notified when the source changes. Your cache updates immediately, and your users always see fresh data.

You can even invalidate records manually, or implement write-through caching so updates flow both ways.

## Example: Caching Expensive Dog Work (Non‚ÄìThird-Party)

Caching isn‚Äôt just for third-party APIs. You can also cache results of expensive work inside your own app‚Äîfor example, computing detailed statistics about dogs.

Here‚Äôs a resource that simulates a slow calculation (delayed by 2 seconds) to generate a ‚Äúdog score‚Äù based on the name length:

```javascript
class DogStats extends Resource {
	async get() {
		// simulate a slow computation
		await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 2000));
		return { score: this.getId().length * 42 };
	}
}

const { DogStatsCache } = tables;
DogStatsCache.sourcedFrom(DogStats);
```

Now when you hit `/DogStatsCache/fido`, the first request takes ~2 seconds. After that, requests return instantly from the cache until the entry expires.

## Step 5: Layer Caches for Your Users

Caching doesn‚Äôt stop at Harper. Because every Harper cache table is a REST API, your clients can cache responses downstream too. Harper automatically tags responses with ETag headers so browsers or edge caches can hold onto data for the appropriate amount of time. That means your app is fast all the way down‚Äîfrom the source, to Harper, to the client.

## Example: Inspecting Dog Cache Behavior

Let‚Äôs see what caching looks like in practice with the `BreedCache` table.

First request (miss, goes to source):

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:9926/BreedCache/husky
```

You‚Äôll see a `200 OK` and a body with breed info. Importantly, Harper includes an ETag header, like:

```bash
ETag: "1727223589-husky"
```

Second request (hit, using ETag):

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:9926/BreedCache/husky \
  -H 'If-None-Match: "1727223589-husky"'
```

Now Harper replies with:

```bash
304 Not Modified

```

No body is returned, and your client can reuse its cached data. Without sending back the ETag, you‚Äôll always get a `200` instead of a `304`‚Äîso sending the tag is critical for real cache hits.

## Why This Matters

With Harper, caching is not a bolt-on. You don‚Äôt need Redis, a CDN, and custom scripts to glue everything together. You just define a schema and a source, and Harper handles:

- Expiration and eviction policies
- Preventing cache stampedes
- Active vs passive updates
- Downstream caching with HTTP headers

In minutes, you‚Äôve gone from ‚Äúslow and costly API calls‚Äù to a fully distributed, low-latency, schema-driven cache layer.

## Next Steps

Try expanding your Dog API with a BreedCache table and connect it to a real dog breed service. Then experiment with expiration times, or try active caching if your data source supports subscriptions.

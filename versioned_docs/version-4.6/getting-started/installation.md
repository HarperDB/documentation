# Install Harper

You can get Harper running in minutes.  
Choose the option that fits your workflow:  

- **NPM** â†’ best for local development & quick starts.  
- **Docker** â†’ best for containerized environments and team setups.  
- **Raw binary** â†’ best if you need a manual or offline install.  

---

## Install with NPM (fastest way)

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS or newer). Then run:

```bash
npm install -g harperdb
harperdb
```

Thatâ€™s it! Harper is now running locally.
The first time, youâ€™ll set up your destination, username, password, and config.

âœ… Quick check: open http://localhost:9925 or run:
```bash
curl http://localhost:9925/health
```

ðŸ’¡ Why choose npm: Itâ€™s the simplest way to try Harper and build apps right from your laptop.

## Install with Docker
Want Harper in a container? Pull the image:

```bash
docker pull harperdb/harperdb
```

Start a container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 9925:9925 harperdb/harperdb
```

âœ… Quick check:
```bash
curl http://localhost:9925/health
```

For persistent storage and secure configs, mount a volume and pass environment variables:
```bash
docker run -d \
  -v <host_directory>:/home/harperdb/hdb \
  -e HDB_ADMIN_USERNAME=HDB_ADMIN \
  -e HDB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password \
  -p 9925:9925 \
  harperdb/harperdb
```

:::info
ðŸ’¡ Why choose Docker: Great for consistent team environments, CI/CD pipelines, or deploying Harper alongside other services.

## Install from Raw Binary

```bash
npm install -g harperdb-X.X.X.tgz
harperdb install
```

:::info
ðŸ’¡ Why choose Raw Binary: Works without Docker, ideal for controlled environments.

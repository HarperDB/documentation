### HarperDB 2.3.1, Penny Release

1/29/2021

**Bug Fixes**

- CORE-1218 A bug in HarperDB 2.3.0 was identified related to manually calling the `create_attribute` operation. This bug caused secondary indexes to be overwritten by the most recently inserted or updated value for the index, thereby causing a search operation filtered with that index to only return the most recently inserted/updated row. Note, this issue does not affect attributes that are reflexively/automatically created. It only affects attributes created using `create_attribute`. To resolve this issue in 2.3.0 or earlier, drop and recreate your table using reflexive attribute creation. In 2.3.1, drop and recreate your table and use either reflexive attribute creation or `create_attribute`.
- CORE-1219 Increased maximum table attributes from 1000 to 10000

# Analytics

Harper provides extensive telemetry and analytics data to help monitor the status of the server and work loads, and to help understand traffic and usage patterns to identify issues and scaling needs, and identify queries and actions that are consuming the most resources.

Harper collects statistics for all operations, URL endpoints, and messaging topics, aggregating information by thread, operation, resource, and methods, in real-time. These statistics are logged in the `hdb_raw_analytics` and `hdb_analytics` table in the `system` database.

There are two "levels" of analytics in the Harper analytics table: the first is the immediate level of raw direct logging of real-time statistics. These analytics entries are recorded once a second (when there is activity) by each thread, and include all recorded activity in the last second, along with system resource information. The records have a primary key that is the timestamp in milliseconds since epoch. This can be queried (with `superuser` permission) using the search_by_conditions operation (this will search for 10 seconds worth of analytics) on the `hdb_raw_analytics` table:

```
POST http:/localhost:9925
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "operation": "search_by_conditions",
    "schema": "system",
    "table": "hdb_raw_analytics",
    "conditions": [{
        "search_attribute": "id",
        "search_type": "between",
        "search_value": [168859400000, 1688594010000]
    }]
}
```

And a typical response looks like:

```
{
    "time": 1688594390708,
    "period": 1000.8336279988289,
    "metrics": [
      {
        "metric": "bytes-sent",
        "path": "search_by_conditions",
        "type": "operation",
        "median": 202,
        "mean": 202,
        "p95": 202,
        "p90": 202,
        "count": 1
      },
      ...
      {
        "metric": "memory",
        "threadId": 2,
        "rss": 1492664320,
        "heapTotal": 124596224,
        "heapUsed": 119563120,
        "external": 3469790,
        "arrayBuffers": 798721
      },
      {
        "metric": "utilization",
        "idle": 138227.52767700003,
        "active": 70.5066209952347,
        "utilization": 0.0005098165086230495
      }
    ],
    "threadId": 2,
    "totalBytesProcessed": 12182820,
    "id": 1688594390708.6853
}
```

The second level of analytics recording is aggregate data. The aggregate records are recorded once a minute, and aggregate the results from all the per-second entries from all the threads, creating a summary of statistics once a minute. The ids for these milliseconds since epoch can be queried from the `hdb_analytics` table. You can query these with an operation like:

```
POST http:/localhost:9925
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "operation": "search_by_conditions",
    "schema": "system",
    "table": "hdb_analytics",
    "conditions": [{
        "search_attribute": "id",
        "search_type": "between",
        "search_value": [1688194100000, 1688594990000]
    }]
}
```

And a summary record looks like:

```
{
    "period": 60000,
    "metric": "bytes-sent",
    "method": "connack",
    "type": "mqtt",
    "median": 4,
    "mean": 4,
    "p95": 4,
    "p90": 4,
    "count": 1,
    "id": 1688589569646,
    "time": 1688589569646
}
```

# Standard Analytics Metrics

While applications can define their own metrics, Harper provides a set of standard metrics that are tracked for all services:

## HTTP

The following metrics are tracked for all HTTP requests:

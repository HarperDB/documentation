### HarperDB 3.1.4, Monkey Release

2/24/2022

**Features/Updates**

- CORE-1460 Added new setting `STORAGE_WRITE_ASYNC`. If this setting is true, LMDB will have faster write performance at the expense of not being crash safe. The default for this setting is false, which results in HarperDB being crash safe.

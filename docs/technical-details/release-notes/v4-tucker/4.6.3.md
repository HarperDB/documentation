# 4.6.3
7/30/2025

- Fix for calling table.operation()
- Do not free/remove the shared user buffer that is used by all threads as an atomic counter for ids (for blobs and incremented ids), but retain it as a stable allocated buffer
- Removed the `copyTablesToCatchUp` option and instead utilized the clone node designation of the leader node to copy tables
- Ensure that skipping large number of audit entries does not lock up the thread and cause a connection reset

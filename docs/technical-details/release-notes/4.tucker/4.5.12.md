### HarperDB 4.5.12
7/9/2025

- Fix for dynamically setting `harperdb` package symlink on deploy
- Assign shard numbers from each node's config rather than from routes
- Handle certificates without a common name, falling back to the SANs
- Properly clean up blobs that are only transiently used for replication 
- Ensure that we always set up server.shards even when there are no TLS connections

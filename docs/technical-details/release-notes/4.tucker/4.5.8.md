* Fix MQTT subscription topics with trailing slashes to ensure they are not treated as a wildcard
* Fix the arguments that are used for the default connect/subscribe calls so they pass the second argument from connect like `connect(incomingMessages, query) -> subscribe(query)`

* Added more descriptive error messages on errors in user residency functions

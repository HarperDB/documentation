### HarperDB 4.3.0, Tucker Release
1/10/2024

### Relationships and Joins

HarperDB now supports defining relationships between tables. These relationships can be defined as one-to-many or many-to-one, and use a foreign key to record the relationship between records from different tables. An example of how to use this to define a many-to-one relationship between a product and brand table:
```graphql
type Product @table {
	id: ID @primaryKey
	name: String @indexed
	# foreign key used to reference a brand
	brandId: ID @indexed
	# many-to-one relationship to brand
	brand: Related @relation(from: "brandId") 
}
type Brand @table {
	id: ID @primaryKey
	name: String @indexed
	# one-to-many relationship of brand to products of that brand
	products: Product @relation(to: "brandId")
}
```
This relationships model can be used in queries and selects, which will automatically "join" the data from the tables. For example, you could search for products by brand name:
```
/Product?brand.name=Microsoft
```

### CLI Expansion

The HarperDB now supports an expansive set of commands that execute operations from the operations API. For example, you can list users from the command line:
```bash
harperdb list_users
```

### BigInt Support

HarperDB now supports BigInt with integers (with full precision) up to 1000 bits (or 10^301). These can be used as primary keys or standard attributes, and can be used in queries or other operations.

# Using NPM and Git

Custom function projects can be structured and managed like normal Node.js projects. You can include external dependencies, include them in your route and helper files, and manage your revisions without changing your development tooling or pipeline.



* To initialize your project to use npm packages, use the terminal to execute `npm init` from the root of your project folder.

* To implement version control using git, use the terminal to execute `git init` from the root of your project folder.

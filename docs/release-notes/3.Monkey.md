_Hi, I am Monkey, a.k.a. Monk, a.k.a. Monchichi. My dad is Aron Johnson, the Director of DevOps at HarperDB. I am an eight-year-old Australian Cattle dog mutt whose favorite pastime is hunting and collecting tennis balls from the park next to her home. I love burrowing in the Colorado snow, rolling in the cool grass on warm days, and cheese!_

# Security

Harper uses role-based, attribute-level security to ensure that users can only gain access to the data they're supposed to be able to access. Our granular permissions allow for unparalleled flexibility and control, and can actually lower the total cost of ownership compared to other database solutions, since you no longer have to replicate subsets of your data to isolate use cases.

## Authentication

- [JWT Authentication](security/jwt-auth) - Token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- [Basic Authentication](security/basic-auth) - Username and password authentication
- [mTLS Authentication](security/mtls-auth) - Mutual TLS certificate-based authentication

## Certificate Management

- [Certificate Management](security/certificate-management) - Managing certificates and Certificate Authorities
- [Certificate Verification](security/certificate-verification) - Certificate revocation checking (CRL/OCSP)

## Access Control

- [Configuration](security/configuration) - Security configuration and settings
- [Users and Roles](security/users-and-roles) - Role-based access control and permissions

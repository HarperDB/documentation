# Operations API

The operations API provides a full set of capabilities for configuring, deploying, administering, and controlling Harper. To send operations to the operations API, you send a POST request to the operations API endpoint, which [defaults to port 9925](../../deployments/configuration#operationsapi), on the root path, where the body is the operations object. These requests need to authenticated, which can be done with [basic auth](../security/basic-auth) or [JWT authentication](../security/jwt-auth). For example, a request to create a table would be performed as:

```http
POST https://my-harperdb-server:9925/
Authorization: Basic YourBase64EncodedInstanceUser:Pass
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "operation": "create_table",
    "table": "my-table"
}
```

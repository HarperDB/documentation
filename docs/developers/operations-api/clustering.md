# Clustering

The following operations are available for configuring and managing [Harper replication](../replication/).\


_**If you are using NATS for clustering, please see the**_ [_**NATS Clustering Operations**_](clustering-nats.md) _**documentation.**_

## Add Node

Adds a new Harper instance to the cluster. If `subscriptions` are provided, it will also create the replication relationships between the nodes. If they are not provided a fully replicating system will be created. [Learn more about adding nodes here](../replication/).

_Operation is restricted to super\_user roles only_

* operation _(required)_ - must always be `add_node`
* hostname or url _(required)_ - one of these fields is required. You must provide either the `hostname` or the `url` of the node you want to add
* verify\_tls _(optional)_ - a boolean which determines if the TLS certificate should be verified. This will allow the Harper default self-signed certificates to be accepted. Defaults to `true`
* authorization _(optional)_ - an object or a string which contains the authorization information for the node being added. If it is an object, it should contain `username` and `password` fields. If it is a string, it should use HTTP `Authorization` style credentials
* retain_authorization _(optional)_ - a boolean which determines if the authorization credentials should be retained/stored and used everytime a connection is made to this node. If `true`, the authorization will be stored on the node record. Generally this should not be used, as mTLS/certificate based authorization is much more secure and safe, and avoids the need for storing credentials. Defaults to `false`.
* revoked_certificates _(optional)_ - an array of revoked certificates serial numbers. If a certificate is revoked, it will not be accepted for any connections.
* shard _(optional)_ - a number which can be used to indicate which shard this node belongs to. This is only needed if you are using sharding.
* subscriptions _(optional)_ - The relationship created between nodes. If not provided a fully replicated cluster will be setup. Must be an object array and include `database`, `table`, `subscribe` and `publish`:
  * database - the database to replicate
  * table - the table to replicate
  * subscribe - a boolean which determines if transactions on the remote table should be replicated on the local table
  * publish - a boolean which determines if transactions on the local table should be replicated on the remote table

### Body

```json
{
    "operation": "add_node",
    "hostname": "server-two",
    "verify_tls": false,
    "authorization": {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "password"
    }
}
```

### Response: 200

```json
{
    "message": "Successfully added 'server-two' to cluster"
}
```

## Update Node

Modifies an existing Harper instance in the cluster.

_Operation is restricted to super\_user roles only_

_Note: will attempt to add the node if it does not exist_

* operation _(required)_ - must always be `update_node`
* hostname _(required)_ - the `hostname` of the remote node you are updating
* revoked_certificates _(optional)_ - an array of revoked certificates serial numbers. If a certificate is revoked, it will not be accepted for any connections.
* shard _(optional)_ - a number which can be used to indicate which shard this node belongs to. This is only needed if you are using sharding.
* subscriptions _(required)_ - The relationship created between nodes. Must be an object array and include `database`, `table`, `subscribe` and `publish`:
  * database - the database to replicate from
  * table - the table to replicate from
  * subscribe - a boolean which determines if transactions on the remote table should be replicated on the local table
  * publish - a boolean which determines if transactions on the local table should be replicated on the remote table

### Body

```json
{
  "operation": "update_node",
  "hostname": "server-two",
  "subscriptions": [
      {
      "database": "dev",
      "table": "my-table",
      "subscribe": true,
      "publish": true
      }
  ]
}
```

### Response: 200

```json
{
    "message": "Successfully updated 'server-two'"
}
```

***

## Remove Node

Removes a Harper node from the cluster and stops replication, [Learn more about remove node here](../replication/).

_Operation is restricted to super\_user roles only_

* operation _(required)_ - must always be `remove_node`
* name _(required)_ - The name of the node you are removing

### Body

```json
{
    "operation": "remove_node",
    "hostname": "server-two"
}
```

### Response: 200

```json
{
    "message": "Successfully removed 'server-two' from cluster"
}
```

***

## Cluster Status

Returns an array of status objects from a cluster.

`database_sockets` shows the actual websocket connections that exist between nodes.

_Operation is restricted to super\_user roles only_

* operation _(required)_ - must always be `cluster_status`

### Body

```json
{
    "operation": "cluster_status"
}
```

### Response: 200

```json
{
  "type": "cluster-status",
  "connections": [
    {
      "replicateByDefault": true,
      "replicates": true,
      "url": "wss://server-2.domain.com:9933",
      "name": "server-2.domain.com",
      "subscriptions": null,
      "database_sockets": [
        {
          "database": "data",
          "connected": true,
          "latency": 0.70,
          "thread_id": 1,
          "nodes": [
            "server-2.domain.com"
          ],
          "lastCommitConfirmed": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 19:09:34 GMT",
          "lastReceivedRemoteTime": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 16:49:29 GMT",
          "lastReceivedLocalTime": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 16:50:59 GMT",
          "lastSendTime": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 16:50:59 GMT"
        },
    }
  ],
  "node_name": "server-1.domain.com",
  "is_enabled": true
}
```
There is a separate socket for each database for each node. Each node is represented in the connections array, and each database connection to that node is represented in the `database_sockets` array. Additional timing statistics include:
* `lastCommitConfirmed`: When a commit is sent out, it should receive a confirmation from the remote server; this is the last receipt of confirmation of an outgoing commit.
* `lastReceivedRemoteTime`: This is the timestamp of the transaction that was last received. The timestamp is from when the original transaction occurred.
* `lastReceivedLocalTime`: This is local time when the last transaction was received. If there is a different between this and `lastReceivedRemoteTime`, it means there is a delay from the original transaction to * receiving it and so it is probably catching-up/behind.
* `sendingMessage`: The timestamp of transaction is actively being sent. This won't exist if the replicator is waiting for the next transaction to send.

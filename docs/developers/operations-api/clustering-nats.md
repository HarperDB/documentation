# Clustering using NATS

## Cluster Set Routes
Adds a route/routes to either the hub or leaf server cluster configuration. This operation behaves as a PATCH/upsert, meaning it will add new routes to the configuration while leaving existing routes untouched.

_Operation is restricted to super_user roles only_

* operation _(required)_ - must always be `cluster_set_routes`
* server _(required)_ - must always be `hub` or `leaf`, in most cases you should use `hub` here
* routes _(required)_ - must always be an objects array with a host and port:
  * host - the host of the remote instance you are clustering to
  * port - the clustering port of the remote instance you are clustering to, in most cases this is the value in `clustering.hubServer.cluster.network.port` on the remote instance `harperdb-config.yaml`

### Body
```json
{
    "operation": "cluster_set_routes",
    "server": "hub",
    "routes": [
        {
            "host": "3.22.181.22",
            "port": 12345
        },
        {
            "host": "3.137.184.8",
            "port": 12345
        },
        {
            "host": "18.223.239.195",
            "port": 12345
        },
        {
            "host": "18.116.24.71",
            "port": 12345
        }
    ]
}
```

### Response: 200
```json

        {
            "host": "3.22.181.22",

# Security

HarperDB uses role-based, attribute-level security to ensure that users can only gain access to the data theyâ€™re supposed to be able to access. Our granular permissions allow for unparalleled flexibility and control, and can actually lower the Total Cost of Ownership compared to other database solutions, since you no longer have to replicate subsets of your data to isolate use cases.

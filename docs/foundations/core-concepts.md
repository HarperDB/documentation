# Core Concepts

Before you build your first app with Harper, it helps to understand a few key ideas. These concepts show you how Harper is structured and why it‚Äôs flexible enough to power everything from a quick proof-of-concept to a production-ready platform.

## Components

**Components** are the building blocks of Harper.  
They‚Äôre JavaScript-based modules that extend Harper‚Äôs core, and they can talk directly to Harper‚Äôs [Global APIs](../reference/globals) (databases, tables, resources).

Because components can build on top of each other, they give you composability. For example, both [Applications](../developers/applications/) and [Extensions](../reference/components/built-in-extensions) are just kinds of components:

- **Plugins** add individual capabilities, like defining tables or serving static assets.
- **Applications** pull multiple plugins and resources together into a complete product.

üí° **Why it matters:** Instead of wiring up a backend from scratch, you can piece together pre-built functionality and get to working endpoints fast.

## Applications (a type of Component)

An **application** is a special kind of component that pulls everything together.  
Applications rely on plugins to do the work:

- Use `graphqlSchema` to define your data tables.
- Add `rest` to query that data instantly.
- Plug in `static` to serve files or front-end assets.

You can even run full frameworks like [Next.js](https://github.com/HarperDB/nextjs) or [Apollo](https://github.com/HarperDB/apollo) as Harper applications.

:::info
üí° **Why it matters:** Applications are how you ship real products on Harper. They let you stitch together resources, APIs, and UI in one place.

## Plugins (formerly Extensions)

Harper has a special kind of component that isn‚Äôt meant to run standalone, but instead adds features to applications or other components. These were originally called **extensions**, and the newer API calls them **plugins**. Both terms refer to the same concept, but ‚Äúplugin‚Äù is the direction going forward.

Examples you‚Äôll see in the ecosystem include:

- [graphqlSchema](../reference/components/built-in-extensions#graphqlschema) for database and table definitions
- [rest](../reference/components/built-in-extensions#rest) for RESTful access to your data
- [static](../reference/components/built-in-extensions#static) for serving files or frontend assets
- [@harperdb/nextjs](https://github.com/HarperDB/nextjs) for Next.js integration
- [@harperdb/apollo](https://github.com/HarperDB/apollo) for Apollo GraphQL

Some built-in extensions have already been rewritten as plugins, so you may encounter both names in the documentation. Where possible, prefer the plugin version for new projects.

:::info
üí° **Why it matters:** Plugins (formerly extensions) give Harper its flexibility. You can compose them into applications to get powerful functionality without writing boilerplate yourself.
:::

## Resources

**Resources** are Harper‚Äôs data layer and are implemented using the `Resource` class.  
They represent databases, tables, and other data entities, and they provide a unified API for accessing, querying, modifying, and monitoring records.

At the simplest level, resources let you:

- Define schemas and tables for your application data.
- Query and update that data through Harper‚Äôs APIs.
- Extend the base `Resource` class with JavaScript to define custom data sources or behaviors.

Each `Resource` instance can represent a single record or a collection of records at a given point in time.  
Static methods on the `Resource` class handle common operations like parsing paths, running transactions, and enforcing access controls, while instance methods give you a transactional view of individual records.

:::info
üí° **Why it matters:** Whether you‚Äôre working with standard tables or custom-defined resources, everything in Harper‚Äôs data layer builds on the same model. This gives you consistency when modeling data and flexibility to extend it with your own logic
:::

## Server

At the edge of Harper is the **server layer**, which connects your data to the outside world. Harper supports REST/HTTP, WebSockets, MQTT, and more. A single resource can be available through multiple protocols at once‚Äîso the same table can power a real-time dashboard, a mobile app, and a backend API.

:::info
üí° **Why it matters:** You don‚Äôt have to choose between protocols. One data model, many ways to access it.

‚úÖ With these concepts in mind, you‚Äôre ready to [build your first application](../getting-started/quickstart). That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll see how Components, Resources, and Extensions come together in practice.

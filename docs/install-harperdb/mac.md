# Mac Development Requirements

MacOS is not recommended as a production operating system, but it is great for development. For more information on standard HarperDB installation visit the HarperDB Command Line Interface guide. This page details the unique cases you may run into when installing on Mac.

Please note, HarperDB suggests using our recommended Node.js version as a prerequisite to installation, but we support Node.js versions 14.0.0 & higher. For our recommended Node.js version please check our [NPM page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/harperdb).

To install HarperDB please visit the npm install guide: https://www.npmjs.com/package/harperdb.

or from the command line:
```bash 
npm install -g harperdb
harperdb
```

# Mac Development Requirements

MacOS is not recommended as a production operating system, but it is great for development. For more information on standard HarperDB installation visit the HarperDB Command Line Interface guide. This page details the unique cases you may run into when installing on Mac.



Please note, HarperDB suggests Node.js v18.12.0 as a prerequisite to installation, but we allow Node.js versions 14.0.0 & higher. [Learn more here](https://harperdb.io/docs/install-harperdb/node-version/).

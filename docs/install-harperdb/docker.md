# With Docker

For development and testing activities, install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) on your Mac or Windows computer.

Otherwise, install the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your Linux server.

Once Docker Desktop or Docker Engine is installed, visit our [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/harperdb/harperdb) for information and examples on how to run a HarperDB container.

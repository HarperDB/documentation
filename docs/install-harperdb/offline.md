# Offline Install

If you need to install HarperDB on a device that doesn't have an Internet connection, you can download the npm package and install it directly (you’ll still need Node.js and NPM):

[Download Install Package](https://registry.npmjs.org/harperdb/-/harperdb-3.3.0.tgz)

Once you’ve downloaded the .tgz file, run the following command from the directory where you’ve placed it:

```bash
npm install -g harperdb-X.X.X.tgz harperdb install
```

For more information visit the [HarperDB Command Line Interface](../administration/harperdb-cli.md) guide.

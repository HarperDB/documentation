# Offline Install

If you need to install HarperDB on a device that doesn't have an Internet connection, you can download the npm package and install it directly (you’ll still need Node.js and NPM):

# need download install package button here
Once you’ve downloaded the .tgz file, run the following command from the directory where you’ve placed it:

```bash
npm install -g harperdb-X.X.X.tgz harperdb install
```

# Node Version Requirement

HarperDB installations suggest Node.js version 16.17.0, and will accept earlier versions as far as 14.0.0, in order to be installed. We recommend using Node Version Manager (nvm) to manage your Node.js installations, an example of how to install HarperDB using nvm can be found on our Linux Install doc.



HarperDB 4.0.0, our current release, suggests Node.js v16.17.0.

# Node Version Requirement

HarperDB supports Node.js versions 14.0.0 and higher, however, **please check our [NPM page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/harperdb) for our recommended Node.js version.**

We recommend using Node Version Manager (nvm) to manage your Node.js installations, an example of how to install HarperDB using nvm can be found on our [Linux Install doc](linux.md).

# HarperDB SQL Guide

The purpose of this guide is to describe the available functionality of HarperDB as it relates to supported SQL functionality.  The SQL parser is still actively being developed and this document will be updated as more features and functionality becomes available.  **A high-level view of supported features can be found here.**



HarperDB adheres to the concept of schemas & tables.  This allows developers to isolate table structures from each other all within one database.

# Create an Organization

What is an organization?
An organization is a way to group and manage multiple clusters and users within Fabric Studio. Organizations help you:
- Organize your clusters and resources
- Control access based on roles and permissions
- Collaborate with team members effectively.
- Manage billing and subscriptions for multiple clusters under a single entity.

To create a new organization in Fabric Studio, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Fabric Studio account.
2. Click on the "New Organization" button in the right of the sub-menu.
3. Enter Organization Details:
   - **Name**: The name of your organization.
   - **Subdomain**: This will be part of the host name URL for accessing your organization's clusters  (e.g., with subdomain "acme" the cluster full host name would be: `<cluster name>.acme.harperfabric.com`).

4. Click the "Create New Organization" button to finalize the creation of your new organization.

Once your organization is created, you can invite team members and manage your organization's settings.

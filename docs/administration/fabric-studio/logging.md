# Logging

## Log Filtering
Log filtering allows users to customize the log output based on specific criteria. This can help in isolating relevant information and reducing noise in the logs list.
To filter logs:
1. Navigate to the "Logs" section in Fabric Studio.
2. Use the filter options available at the left side menu logs list to specify criteria such as:
    - Log Limit: The maximum number of log entries to display(e.g. 10, 100, 250, 500, 1000) (default is 100)
    - Log Level (e.g., Error, Warn, Info, Debug, Trace, Notify, All) (default is All)
    - Start Date: The beginning date and time for the log entries to display
    - End Date: The ending date and time for the log entries to display

3. Click the "Apply Filters" button to update the log list based on the selected criteria.
4. The log list will refresh to show only the entries that match the specified filters.


## Log Details
To view detailed information about a specific log entry:
1. Navigate to the "Logs" section in Fabric Studio.
2. Click on a log entry in the logs list to open the log details modal.
3. The log details modal will display comprehensive information about the selected log entry, including:
    - Timestamp: The date and time when the log entry was created
    - Level: The severity level of the log entry (e.g., Error, Warn)
    - Thread: The thread identifier where the log entry originated
    - Tags: Any associated tags for categorizing the log entry
    - Message: The main content of the log entry
4. Review the information in the modal to gain insights into the specific event or issue recorded in the log entry.

# Logging

Harper provides many different logging options for various features and functionality.

- [Standard Logging](logging/standard-logging): Harper maintains a log of events that take place throughout operation.
- [Audit Logging](logging/audit-logging): Harper uses a standard Harper table to track transactions. For each table a user creates, a corresponding table will be created to track transactions against that table.
- [Transaction Logging](logging/transaction-logging): Harper stores a verbose history of all transactions logged for specified database tables, including original data records.

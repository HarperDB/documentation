# Logging

HarperDB provides many different logging options for various features and functionality.&#x20;

* [Standard Logging](logging.md): HarperDB maintains a log of events that take place throughout operation.
* [Audit Logging](audit-logging.md): HarperDB uses a standard HarperDB table to track transactions. For each table a user creates, a corresponding table will be created to track transactions against that table.
* [Transaction Logging](transaction-logging.md): HarperDB stores a verbose history of all transactions logged for specified database table, including original data records.

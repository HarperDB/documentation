# Instance Metrics

The Harper Studio display instance status and metrics on the instance status page, which can be accessed with the following instructions:

1. Navigate to the [Harper Studio Organizations](https://studio.harperdb.io/organizations) page.
2. Click the appropriate organization that the instance belongs to.
3. Select your desired instance.
4. Click **status** in the instance control bar.

Once on the instance browse page you can view host system information, [Harper logs](../logging/logging.md), and [Harper Cloud alarms](../../deployments/harper-cloud/alarms.md) (if it is a cloud instance).

_Note, the **status** page will only be available to super users._

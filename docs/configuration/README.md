# Configuration File

HarperDB is configured through a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file called `harperdb-config.yaml` located in the operations API root directory (by default this is a directory named `hdb` located in the home directory of the current user).

All available configuration will be populated by default in the config file on install, regardless of whether it is used.

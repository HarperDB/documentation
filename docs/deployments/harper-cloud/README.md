# Harper Cloud

[Harper Cloud](https://studio.harperdb.io/) is the easiest way to test drive Harper, itâ€™s Harper-as-a-Service. Cloud handles deployment and management of your instances in just a few clicks. Harper Cloud is currently powered by AWS with additional cloud providers on our roadmap for the future.

You can create a new [Harper Cloud instance in the Harper Studio](../../administration/harperdb-studio/instances.md#create-a-new-instance).

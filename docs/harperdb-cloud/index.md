# HarperDB Cloud

HarperDB Cloud is the easiest way to test drive HarperDB, it’s HarperDB-as-a-Service. Cloud handles deployment and management of your instances in just a few clicks. HarperDB Cloud is currently powered by AWS with additional cloud providers on our roadmap for the future.



HarperDB Cloud is managed within the HarperDB Studio. It’s free to sign up, and you even get a free instance- forever!

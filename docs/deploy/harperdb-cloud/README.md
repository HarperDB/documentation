# HarperDB Cloud

[HarperDB Cloud](https://studio.harperdb.io/) is the easiest way to test drive HarperDB, itâ€™s HarperDB-as-a-Service. Cloud handles deployment and management of your instances in just a few clicks. HarperDB Cloud is currently powered by AWS with additional cloud providers on our roadmap for the future.

You can create a new [HarperDB Cloud instance in the HarperDB Studio](../../admin/harperdb-studio/instances.md#create-a-new-instance).

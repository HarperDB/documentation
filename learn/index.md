title: Welcome to Harper Learn
---

This documentation section contains thorough guides for learning how to develop and manage applications with Harper. The guides are present in a logical order to build up knowledge across Harper's vast feature set. The guides are example based and provide a hands-on approach to teaching and demonstrating key features. Guides can be referenced independently, but assume the reader is familiar with concepts presented in previous guides.

For example, the [Loading Data]() guide assumes the reader already knows how to build a basic Harper application (covered in ), create databases and tables using schemas, and some basic query techniques. Those concepts are specifically covered throughout the [Getting Started](), [Key Harper Application Features](), and [Defining Databases and Tables]() guides.

Most guides present both local-based and [Harper Fabric]() cloud-based examples and instructions. Regardless, in order to properly complete all examples, we recommend the following prerequisite tools installed and configured on your local machine:

- Command line access and general file-system and networking permissions
  - `sudo` is not required
  - For local development, Harper requires permission to read/write files and localhost networking permissions
- HTTP Client of choice
  - Most examples will present both curl and fetch based HTTP requests
  - GUI-based HTTP clients will also work fine and is left 
- Node.js Current, Active LTS, or Maintenance LTS version
  - For more information see [Node.js Releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)
  - Verify your Node.js version by running `node -v` in the command line
- Code editor of choice
  - Everything from `vim` to Visual Studio Code to WebStorm IDE will work fine for the purposes of these guides

:::info

Eagle-eye developers may notice some things still reference Harper's previous name, HarperDB.

The "database" part is not gone, Harper has simply evolved to become so much more than _just_ a database.
Harper is one-and-the-same with HarperDB, so please bare with us as we chip away at some renames.

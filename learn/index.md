Welcome to Harper Learn!

This section contains thorough guides for learning how to build applications and more with Harper.

Each guide contains all necessary prerequisite and setup instructions for examples.

The guides are presented in a logical order to built up knowledge across Harper's vast features set. Guides can be referenced independently, but will assume the reader is familiar with concepts contained within previous guides. For example, the [Loading Data]() guide assumes the reader already knows how to build a basic Harper application, create databases and tables using schemas, and some basic query techniques. Those concepts are specifically covered throughout the [Getting Started](), [Key Harper Application Features](), and [Defining Databases and Tables]() guides.

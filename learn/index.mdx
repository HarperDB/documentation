This documentation section contains thorough guides for learning how to develop and manage applications with Harper. The guides are present in a logical order to build up knowledge across Harper's vast feature set. The guides are example based and provide a hands-on approach to teaching and demonstrating key features. Guides can be referenced independently, but assume the reader is familiar with concepts presented in previous guides.

{/**
Uncomment this when we actually have these guides created
For example, the [Loading Data]() guide assumes the reader already knows how to build a basic Harper application (covered in ), create databases and tables using schemas, and some basic query techniques. Those concepts are specifically covered throughout the [Getting Started](), [Key Harper Application Features](), and [Defining Databases and Tables]() guides.

Most guides present both local-based and [Harper Fabric](https://fabric.harper.fast) cloud-based examples and instructions. Regardless, in order to properly complete all examples, we recommend the following prerequisite tools installed and configured on your local machine:

Eagle-eye developers may notice some things still reference Harper's previous name, HarperDB.

The "database" part is not gone, Harper has simply evolved to become so much more than _just_ a database.
Harper is one-and-the-same with HarperDB, so please bare with us as we chip away at some renames.

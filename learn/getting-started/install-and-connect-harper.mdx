# Install and Connect Harper

Developers have two recommended approaches for developing Harper applications; either locally or with [Harper Fabric](https://fabric.harper.fast), our distributed data application platform service. If you start developing locally, you can always switch to Fabric by deploying your application. If you're interested in setting up a Fabric instance, navigate to the [Fabric](../../fabric/index.md) part of the documentation, and then come back after you have created your first Fabric cluster.

## Install Harper Locally

Harper is published to the npm registry and requires Node.js current, active LTS, or maintenance LTS versions to run.

The fastest way to get started is by installing Harper globally using an npm compatible package manager:

```bash
npm install -g harper
```

Then, execute the Harper CLI to start the interactive installation process:

```bash
harper install
```

After completing the installation, run within the current command process using:

```bash
harper
```

To check if everything is configured correctly and ready to go for development, run a quick health check using the `/health` endpoint available within the Operations API server.

:::note
If you configured a different Operations API port, use that instead of `9925` here.

  <TabItem value="fetch">
```typescript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:9925/health');
const text = await response.text();
console.log(text);
```
  </TabItem>

## Manage and Deploy with Fabric

Fabric is our service for managing and deploying Harper on a distributed network. Fabric makes it easy to create new Harper "clusters", the Harper application platform running on distributed nodes, and deploy your application to this service. Fabric has a management interface, and provides a UI for managing your deployments and even your local instance that you just installed. You can sign up for Fabric for free, and create a free Harper cluster to deploy your application:

- Go to [Fabric](https://fabric.harper.fast) and sign-up for a new account.
  - You will need to agree to the terms of service and verify your email address.
- Once you have created an account, you can create an organization. This will allow you to collaboratively managing your Harper services with others. This will also define the host domain that will be used.
- You can now create a new Harper cluster or instance:
  - Create a free Harper cluster for trying out Harper.
  - Purchase a Harper cluster with higher performance, scalability, and limits.
  - Add your own local instance to manage everything in one place.
- Once you have a Harper cluster, you will be ready to create a new application directly on Fabric, or be ready to deploy an application to Fabric.

Once Harper is running or you are connected to Fabric, we recommend that you walk through the steps of [building your first application](../getting-started/quickstart) and learn more about Harper's concepts and architecture:

- [Build your first application](../getting-started/quickstart)
- Explore the [Core Concepts](../foundations/core-concepts)
- Learn about [Harper's architecture](../foundations/harper-architecture)
- Review [Configuration options](../deployments/configuration)
